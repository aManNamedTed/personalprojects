  Project: Create a program that can calculate the law of sines. Use law of cosines if values permit.
           Make sure these restrictions are acknowledged:
    - No negative answers. If negative, respond with why, either
    - no angles >= 178 because the triangle needs 3 angles, and the other two's lowest angle value can be 1 degree.
