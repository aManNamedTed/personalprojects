## Things to remember

IN JAVA
         | ArrayList | LinkedList |
get()    |    O(1)   |    O(n)    |
add()    |    O(1)   |    O(1) amo|
remove() |    O(n)   |    O(n)    |


### 2. Linked Lists (april 5, 2018)
- Background of ll
- big o of ll
- uses
  - how to reverse a ll?
  
### 3. Stacks
- Background of stacks
- big o of stacks?
- uses
  - question: write a functio nto determine if a string consisting of the chars () is balanced
  
### 4. Queues
- bg of queuess
- big o
- uses
  - ?: given one queue and one stack, how do you reverse the stack?
 
### 5. Hash map (with chaining)
- bg of hm
- big o
- uses
  - ?: implement a word counter (not case sensitive, and ignoring special char (punct.))
  - ?: case sensitive?
  - ?: including special char?
  - ?: resolve hash map collisions
 
### 6. trees
- bg
- big o
- uses
  ?: bst?
  ?: pre order trav
  ?: in order trav
  ?: post order trav
  ?: how to level-order traversal (breadth first search)
  ?: implement a heap
  ?: avl trees
  ?: red-black trees
  ?: b-trees

### 7. Graphs
- bg
- big o
- uses
?: depth first search
?: breadth first search
  

### 8. Dynamic Array
 - implemented with a ring buffer (use a statically sized array under the hood)

### 9. Hash set

### 11. Binary heap 
- (without decrease-key; know that fibonacci heaps exist and know their guarantees)

### 12.Binary search trees 
- (doesn't need to be self balancing; know that self-balancing trees exist and know their guarentees)

### 13. Prefix tree (aka Trie)

### 14. Suffix tree 
- (don't worry about compression, just build a dumb version; know that ukkonen's algo exists and learn its guarantees)
