# Background
After watching gbay100's video, "What Every Young Person Should Know About
Investing And Finance.", I thought I would try to create a simple budget 
calculator. The goal is to make something that works today. So for now, stage
one of development is to make it just work, with numbers only. Then
For now here are the points that gbay touches on in order:
1. Save $1000 for a rainy day fund.
2. Pay off your debt starting with the highest interest rate.
3. Save up to 3-6 months of expenses.
Utilize tax advantage accounts such as 401k or IRA.
Save your age in bonds.
Feel free play around with the calculations below. For the
sake of a disclaimer, I do not save any of the data that is
input below. <br/><br/>
