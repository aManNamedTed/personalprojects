## Why an Auto Email Sender?

<img src="auto_email_sender.png"/>

The idea was born because one of my professors wanted to send emails automatically from a spreadsheet. So I took the idea and ran with it. It probably has the sloppiest javascript you have ever seen but I'm working on it.

I was thinking if this was absolutely necessary for use in the future, I could add figures for displaying the data better than just in plain text.

Aside: I have bigger(?) plans for this.
