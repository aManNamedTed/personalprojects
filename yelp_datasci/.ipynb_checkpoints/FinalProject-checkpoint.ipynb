What about retirement age or proximity to certain facilities like schools, hospitals, airports, etc.? What if the cities we looked at were tourist cities, in which ratings will differ due to the variety of patrons at restaurants. Another confound was that some people may just go to other cities to eat on a regular basis. Therefore, they may review restaurants that are not in the city that they live in. Looking at data in gentrified cities across time could also be helpful. Whether or not ratings change across time, before, during, and after gentrification, could better tackle the question of whether neighborhood affluence affects restaurant ratings."
